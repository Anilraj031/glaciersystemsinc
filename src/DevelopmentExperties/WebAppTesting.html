		Web applications are the core of every digital strategy. They are no longer just information sources, but a primary touchpoint for businesses and brands. Web applications are unique, multifunctional, and complex solutions that require precision, 24/7 up-time, and a custom approach to every function and line of code. Over the past 12+ years, our qualified, ISTQB-certified quality assurance engineers have delivered high-quality web applications. Our web application testing team ensures that every line of code runs smoothly and is perfectly compatible with all the devices, platforms, and systems on which the application will be used and encompasses everything from functionality, UI/UX, usability, and security issues. We evaluate your industry, company needs, and target audience and adapt to the ever-changing demands of your audience/customers. Our web functional testing evaluates each feature of your web application and verifies that it meets all the technology and business requirements. Our functional testing services uncover the system aspects that fail to meet the defined requirements or return expected results. We offer automated, semi-automated, and manual functional testing that ensure the frontend and backend of your web application functions as expected.
